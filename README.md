# United States Accidents Data Analysis
This is Python based Exploratory Data Analysis on "US Accidents" dataset to find out and visualize different trends including impact of COVID-19 on traffic behavior and accidents,  environmental stimuli on accident occurrence and accident hotspot locations in order to get control over the same.

## About Dataset
**US-Accidents: A Countrywide Traffic Accident Dataset**
### Description
This is a countrywide traffic accident dataset, which covers **49 states of the United States.** The data is continuously being collected from February 2016, using several data providers, including two APIs which provide streaming traffic event data. These APIs broadcast traffic events captured by a variety of entities, such as the US and state departments of transportation, law enforcement agencies, traffic cameras, and traffic sensors within the road-networks. Currently, there are about **3 million accident--updated** records in this dataset.
### Content
This dataset has been collected in real-time, using multiple Traffic APIs. Currently, it contains accident data that are collected from February 2016 to Dec 2020 for the Contiguous United States. Check [here](https://smoosavi.org/datasets/us_accidents) to learn more about this dataset.
### Applications of Dataset
US-Accidents can be used for numerous applications such as real-time accident prediction, studying accident hotspot locations, casualty analysis and extracting cause and effect rules to predict accidents, or studying the impact of precipitation or other environmental stimuli on accident occurrence.
